# Lending Club CaseStudy

## Business Understanding
Consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

**If a person is likely to default**
- denying the loan
- reducing the amount of loan
- lending at a higher interest rate

- Fully paid: Applicant has fully paid the loan
- Current: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments
- Charged-off: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time
